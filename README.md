Changes from design document:

1) I couldn't implement the sokoban-style where the nurse had to move chairs and the patient in bed to the correct places because i couldn't figure out how to animate the pushing animation of the nurse and the snap-into-place when the object is pushed into its correct place

2) I omitted the conveyor-belt for the emojis in the communication board because it was simply too hard to implement.
